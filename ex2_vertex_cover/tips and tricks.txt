example how to run the jar:

java -cp vertexcover.jar main.Main 005 random strict 0.95 0.25

"005" is the instance number (in the file name)
"random" is the construction heuristic type (options: random / greedy / worst)
"strict" is the neighbourhood type (options: strict / relaxed)
"0.95" is the cooling rate (value between 0 and 1)
"0.25" is the minimum temperature (stopping condition)

instances have to be placed in an "instances" folder which needs to be on the same level as the jar
a "solutions" folder has to be created, which needs to be on the same level as the jar
